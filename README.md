# Neural Nets in Numpy

Build a Neural Network from scratch using Numpy. Libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow are fast and convenient but building a model from the ground up in Numpy is a great exercise for understanding what's going on under the hood. Read the [blog](https://theoclark.co.uk/posts/neural-networks-from-scratch.html) for more details.

## Usage

The project is written in a Jupyter notebook. There are two versions: version 1 is the streamlined version which just contains the model as described in the blog post, while version 2 contains additional code for visualisation and analysis. There is a third notebook which contains an identical model built in PyTorch for comparison. The notebook is best accessed using google colab to allow instant access to the MNIST dataset.
